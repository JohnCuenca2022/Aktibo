    <string name="homeInfoText">Based on studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the average person is recommended to walk an estimated <b>15000</b> steps per week. Research by Brooks et. al, estimates this number of steps to burn around <b>541</b> kcal, which is a healthy portion of the average person\'s weekly calories to be burned. \n\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans estimates that the average person should burn an estimated 1,600 to 2,400 calories per day for females and 2,000 to 3,000 calories per
day for males kcals in a week. \n\nThese weekly goals may vary for each individual but achieving them is a simple yet effective benchmark to track one\'s healthy lifestyle. </string>
